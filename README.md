# CheckmateCarnage
This is chess like youâ€™ve never seen before.

Checkmate Carnage is a post apocalyptic real time strategy game with the flare of fun and goofy ragdoll physics. Whether you are looking for strategic gameplay, or simply an entertaining display of carnage, this game is for you.

Build your own army with reimagined characters based on the six chess pieces and go to war with your friends.

Hurl your units into the fray until only one king is left standing.

Your army awaits your command!

# Functionality
The gameplay of checkmate carnage revolves around placing units at the start to build your army to fight the other player. You then command the units to move them into battle and pick targets to kill, much like any other RTS game. The game ends when the timer runs out, or when one of the kings dies

Each unit you can place is inspired by the pieces in chess:
- The Pawn; a cheap unit you can throw into the frontlines. They are savages who have let their minds be corrupted by the chaos of the wasteland, moving erratically and throwing themselves at their enemies.
- The Knight; who rides his segway into battle, charges at his enemies to deal damage.
- The Bishop; a healer unit who uses his beliefs to embue his water balloons with holy water to heal his allies.
- The Rook; a tower with a mortar on top, placed to defend areas of the board. This unit can attack in a cross section if enemies get in range.
- The Queen; as fun as she is tough, she prances into battle with her rocket launcher, sending her enemies flying with each rocket she fires.
- The King; the senile old man who managed to convince the dwellers of the wasteland to follow him. Anyone within range of him recieves one of the following buffs; healing, speed boost or damage boost
